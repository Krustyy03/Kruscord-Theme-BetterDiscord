## Features
* Subtle recolor to keep it easy on your eyes.
* How cool are those previews of themes with MacOS title bar buttons, too bad they're not present in the theme. Wait- In Kruscord they are!!
* 'Add Server' button always visible to make joining new servers quick.
* New messages appear with a smooth animation.
* Better 'Jump to present' button for when you wander off into the past.
* Many more visual changes that make Discord alive.

## Installation
* Download Kruscord theme zip file.
* Place Kruscord.theme.css in `C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes`
* Enable it in BetterDiscord themes settings.

## Known Issues
<p align="left"> It's always better to be aware of the bugs beforehand rather than coming across them in an experience disrupting manner.</p>
* Modal notifications (like BDFDB plugin updates) are not functinal. This is due to the title bar modifications. Fix: Theme must be disabled in order to interact with these modals.
* Please inform me if you come across any bugs: Krustyy#3022
